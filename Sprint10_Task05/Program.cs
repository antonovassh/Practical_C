//Suppose we need to work on an error-logging module that logs exception stack traces into a file. You see this solution in the answer box preload.

//The following are the classes that provide the functionality to log a stack trace into a file. Besides this, they provide the storage of this stack trace in a database if an IO exception occurs.

//But whenever the client wants to introduce a new logger, we need to alter ExceptionLogger by adding a new method.If we continue doing this after some time then we will see a fat ExceptionLogger class with a large set of methods that provide the functionality to log a message into various targets. 

//Why does this issue occur? Because ExceptionLogger directly contacts the low-level classes FileLogger and DbLogger to log the exception. We need to alter the design so that this ExceptionLogger class can be loosely coupled with those classes. To do that we need to introduce an abstraction between them so that ExcetpionLogger can contact the abstraction to log the exception instead of depending on the low-level classes directly.
//Your task is to refactor the solution. You have to move to the low-level class’s initiation from the ExcetpionLogger class to the DataExporter class to make ExceptionLogger loosely coupled with the classes FileLogger and DBLogger. And by doing that we are giving provision to DataExporter class to decide what kind of Logger should be called based on the exception that occurs.
